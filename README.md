3. Journal
4. To-do list

### Online social functions:
1. Can make posts whever something is updated
2. Can leave messages or cheer each other on friends' posts
3. Connect with a friend if you are working together on something and manage updates together
4. Creat a separate module for sharing productivity tips, knowledge, and whatnot. Kind of like dev twitter
